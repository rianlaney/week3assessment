		<h1>About</h1>

		<p>
			Hello my name is Rian Laney, I have an affinity for helping others, as a matter of fact I live by one simple statement. What is a man who does not change the world. This simple statement has set me on a path to help 1,000,000 people end their battle with depression and anxiety. After years of battle with depression and anxiety myself I got fed up with living life that way and created my own mood tracking app to help me break free.
